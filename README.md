### Implementing Common ML Models From Scratch

This project was inspired by Assembly AI's [Machine Learning From Scratch Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hGz0w_OCo&list=PLcWfeUsAys2k_xub3mHks85sBHZvg24Jd). 

I implemented the alorithms listed below and then created `Jupyter Notebooks` to test each one. This helped me gain a practical intuition for the inner workings of these foundational machine learning model.

#### Models implemented:
- K-nearest Neighbours
- K-means
- Decision Tree classifier
- Random Forest classifier
- Linear Regression classifier
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Naive Bayes
- Principal Component Analysis
- Support Vector Machine
- Perception
- Neural net (multi-layer perceptron)

#### Skills and technologies used
- All algorithms implemented using only vanilla `python` and `numpy`.
- Testing using `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- One exception is the neural net, which I implemented from scratch and then again using `pytorch`.
